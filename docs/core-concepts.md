# Core Concepts

This document explains the fundamental concepts behind the Kotlin Channel Event Bus implementation.

## Event Bus

An event bus is a messaging pattern that enables different components of an application to communicate with each other without having direct references to one another. This promotes loose coupling and better maintainability.

## Channels in Kotlin

Channels in Kotlin are a concurrency primitive that enables safe communication between coroutines. They can be thought of as pipes that allow you to send and receive values between different parts of your code.

### Key Channel Concepts

1. **Send Operation**: Adding an event to the channel
2. **Receive Operation**: Retrieving an event from the channel
3. **Channel Capacity**: The number of events that can be stored in the channel
4. **Suspension**: Operations that wait for channel space or new events

## Event Types

Events are strongly typed messages that flow through the event bus. Each event type represents a specific kind of message or notification in your application.

Example of defining an event:

```kotlin
data class UserEvent(
    val type: String,
    val userId: String? = null,
    val timestamp: Long = System.currentTimeMillis()
)
```

## Subscribers

Subscribers are functions or coroutines that process specific types of events. They register with the event bus to receive notifications when events of interest are published.

## Publishers

Publishers are components that send events to the event bus. Any part of your application can publish events, and all subscribers listening for that event type will receive them.

## Flow Control

The event bus implements flow control mechanisms to handle scenarios such as:
- Backpressure management
- Event buffering
- Error handling
- Event prioritization

## Thread Safety

The Channel Event Bus is thread-safe by design, leveraging Kotlin's coroutine framework to handle concurrent operations safely and efficiently.
